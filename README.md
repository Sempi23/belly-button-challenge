# Belly-button-Challenge

## Background

The goal of this project eas to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Dashboard Features Created

    1. Drop Down Menu - Used to select the Test Subject ID No. with the drop down menu to toggle the visualizations (bar, bubble charts)
    2. Demographic Info Panel - Shows the selected individual's demographic information as key-value pairs
    3. Horizontal Bar Graph - Displays the top 10 OTUs found in the individual selected from the dropdown menu.
    4. Bubble Chart - Displays each sample.

### Technologies used
- D3.js for data manipulation and binding to DOM elements

- Plotly.js for creating interactive visualizations(horizontal bar chart & bubble chart)
